1. Exceptions: in order to handle errors its good practice to use exception handling keywords to your code. These increase the creadibility of your code.

2. Try, throw and catch are the keywords used for exceptions handling.

3. Syntax
```
try{
    //block of code 
    throw exception;
}

catch(){
    // block of code to handle errors
}

```


4. In the example code of 'exceptions.cpp' file. if the age is less than 18 that will throw an exception and the exception is handled by the catch block.

5. catch block takes a parameter and provide some instruction to the user to try in different way. 


6. Sometimes we don't know the type of our exception then we use (...) to handle anything.
