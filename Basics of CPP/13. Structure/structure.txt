1. Structure is a way to group several related variables into one place. These variables are known as a member of the structure.

2. Structure can have different types of variables.

3. Syntax

```
struct{
    int myNum;
    string myString;
    bool isString;
} myStructure; //variable name of structure

```

4. In order to access the member of structure we can use:

```
myStructure.myNum;

```

5. One struct can be assigned to many variables

```
struct {
  string brand;
  string model;
  int year;
} myCar1, myCar2; // We can add variables by separating them with a comma here

// Put data into the first structure
myCar1.brand = "BMW";
myCar1.model = "X5";
myCar1.year = 1999;

// Put data into the second structure
myCar2.brand = "Ford";
myCar2.model = "Mustang";
myCar2.year = 1969;

// Print the structure members
cout << myCar1.brand << " " << myCar1.model << " " << myCar1.year << "\n";
cout << myCar2.brand << " " << myCar2.model << " " << myCar2.year << "\n";

```


6. Structure as a data type: By giving a name to the structure, we can treat it like a data type.

```
struct DataType1{
    int x;
    string y;
};


int main(){
    DataType1 dt;
    dt.x = 10;
    dt.y = "hello";

    DataType1 dy;
    dy.x = 20;
    dy.y = "Bye";

    cout << dt.x << " " << dy.y<< endl;
}

```
