Encapsulation:

1. The means of Encapsulation is to make sure sensitive data is 'hidden' from the user.

2. The attributes must be declared as private. 

3. There are 'get' and 'set' methods that can be used to get and set the private data.

4. For providing higher level of security to the data we use Encapsulation.
