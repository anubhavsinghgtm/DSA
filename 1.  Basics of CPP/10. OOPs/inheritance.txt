Inheritance

1. It is used to provide the attributes and methods from one class to other.

2. a) base class(parent): from where the attributes and methods are shared.
   b) derived class(child): which inherit the attributes and methods from base class.

```

class Vehicle {
  public:
    string brand = "Ford";
    void honk() {
      cout << "Tuut, tuut! \n" ;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Car: public Vehicle {
  public:
    string model = "Mustang";
};


```

3. Multilevel Inheritance: We can do mulitlevel of Inheritance. For example a is the parent class, b is the derived class of a, and c is the derived class of b. Then there is a multilevel Inheritance. 


4. Multiple Inheritance: A class can also be derived from more than one base class.
Syntax
```
class A : public B, public C{

}

```

-> Class A is inherited from the multiple class B and C


-> After inheritance we can access members from a class those are either public or protected.
